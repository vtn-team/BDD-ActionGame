# Unity Project Analysis (2025-06-28)

## Overall Design:

*   The project follows a component-based architecture, which is standard for Unity development.
*   There's a clear separation of concerns between different game elements (Player, Enemy, GameManager, etc.).
*   The use of interfaces (`IHitTarget`) and base classes (`EnemyBase`, `SkillBase`, `ItemBase`) promotes loose coupling and extensibility.
*   The `StageCreator` provides a good foundation for level design, with a custom editor for ease of use.
*   The input system is handled by Unity's new Input System, which is a good modern practice.

## Potential Issues and Areas for Improvement:

1.  **`HitPointGauge.cs` uses Reflection:**
    *   **Problem:** `HitPointGauge.cs` uses reflection (`GetField`) to access the private `_hitPoint` and `_maxHitPoint` fields of `Player` and `EnemyBase`. While this works, it's slow, error-prone, and breaks encapsulation. If the field names are changed in the future, the UI will break silently.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add public properties or methods to `IHitTarget` or the base classes to expose the necessary HP data. For example, `IHitTarget` could have `float GetNormalizedHitPoints()` or `int GetCurrentHitPoints()` and `int GetMaxHitPoints()`.

2.  **`GameManager.cs` `Update()` performance:**
    *   **Problem:** `GameManager.Update()` calls `FindObjectsByType<EnemyBase>` every frame. This is a very expensive operation and can cause performance issues, especially with many enemies.
    *   **Recommendation:** The `_enemies` array is already populated in `Awake()`. Instead of finding all enemies every frame, you should manage the list of active enemies. When an enemy is defeated, it can be removed from the list or marked as inactive. A good approach would be to have enemies notify the `GameManager` upon their death, perhaps via an event.

3.  **`Bullet.cs` `Update()` performance:**
    *   **Problem:** `Bullet.Update()` calls `FindFirstObjectByType<StageCreator>()` every frame. This is also an expensive call.
    *   **Recommendation:** The `StageCreator` can be cached in the `Start()` or `Awake()` method of the `Bullet` class, or passed in during the `Builder` method.

4.  **Hardcoded Prefab Paths in `Resources.Load()`:**
    *   **Problem:** `Bullet.Builder()` and `HitPointGauge.Builder()` use `Resources.Load("Bullet")` and `Resources.Load("HitPointGauge")`. This hardcodes the path to the prefabs. If the prefabs are moved or renamed, the code will break.
    *   **Recommendation:** It's generally better to use direct references. You can create a "prefab manager" or a scriptable object that holds references to all the necessary prefabs, and then access them from there. Alternatively, the prefabs can be passed in as parameters to the `Builder` methods.

5.  **Player Movement in `Player.cs`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `MoveCoroutine` in `Player.cs` handles the player's dice-like rolling movement. The logic for determining the rotation axis is complex and has a fallback case that might not always produce the desired result.
    *   **Recommendation:** While the current implementation works, it could be simplified. For a grid-based game, you could pre-define the rotation axes for each movement direction. This would make the code cleaner and more predictable.

6.  **Lack of Object Pooling:**
    *   **Problem:** Bullets are instantiated and destroyed frequently. This can lead to performance overhead due to memory allocation and garbage collection.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement an object pooling system for bullets. Instead of destroying bullets, they can be returned to a pool and reused. This is a very common optimization in Unity.

7.  **`StageCreator.cs` `GetValidItemPositions()`:**
    *   **Problem:** This method iterates through the entire stage grid to find valid positions for items. For large stages, this could be slow.
    *   **Recommendation:** If performance becomes an issue, you could maintain a list of valid spawn points that is updated only when the stage changes (e.g., when an obstacle is destroyed).

8.  **Magic Numbers:**
    *   **Problem:** There are several "magic numbers" in the code (e.g., the generator ID in `ShieldBlock.cs`, the heal amount in `HeartItem.cs`).
    *   **Recommendation:** Use named constants or `[SerializeField]` variables for these values to improve readability and maintainability.

## Summary of Recommendations:

*   **High Priority:**
    *   Remove reflection from `HitPointGauge.cs`.
    *   Optimize `GameManager.Update()` to avoid calling `FindObjectsByType` every frame.
    *   Optimize `Bullet.Update()` to avoid calling `FindFirstObjectByType` every frame.
*   **Medium Priority:**
    *   Implement object pooling for bullets.
    *   Refactor `Resources.Load()` calls to use a more robust method for prefab management.
*   **Low Priority:**
    *   Simplify the player movement logic.
    *   Optimize `GetValidItemPositions()` if it becomes a bottleneck.
    *   Replace magic numbers with named constants.
